## Introduction 
1„ÄÅThis project is an on-board assistance system based on target detection algorithm, which also has the ability to detect pedestrians and road defects.  
2„ÄÅThe deployed hardware device is Raspberry Pi 4B.  
3„ÄÅThe specific implementation effect is [bilibili video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EV411M7fK/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)

## Usage
1„ÄÅModel Training  
The models used are yolov5 and yolov5-lite. For the specific training process, refer to [YOLOv5-Lite: README.md](https://github.com/Wangkkklll/yolo_edge/tree/main/YOLOv5-Lite)  
  
2„ÄÅModel deployment  
The framework used for deployment is NCNN. For specific steps, refer to [test320_yolov5_lite: README.md](https://github.com/Wangkkklll/yolo_edge/tree/main/test320_yolov5_lite)  

3„ÄÅVisualization  
Read the coordinates through GPS and call the Amap API to mark them. For details, refer to [Visualization](https://github.com/Wangkkklll/yolo_edge/tree/main/YOLOv5-Lite)  

4„ÄÅDistance measurement module  
The ranging module is divided into ultrasonic ranging and visual ranging. For details, please refer to [Distance](https://github.com/Wangkkklll/yolo_edge/tree/main/YOLOv5-Lite)
